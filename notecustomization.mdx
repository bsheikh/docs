## Where Customization Fits

The optimal workflow is:

1. **Create Template** – define the structure.
2. **Customize Note** – adjust detail and formatting for this encounter.
3. **Learnings** – teach Vero your long-term style.

<Note>
  Customization applies only to the note you’re working on. You can apply it to all notes in the settings.
</Note>

## <u>Detail Level</u>

Use the slider to adjust how detailed your note should be:

- **Concise** – Pertinent positives and negatives only. Ideal for quick visits or brief notes.
- **Balanced** – Clear structure with enough depth for most encounters.
- **Detailed** – Expanded narrative, detailed assessments, and reasoning.

## <u>Quotes</u>

Enable **Quotes** to capture patient statements exactly as they were spoken. This adds emotional context and helps preserve the patient’s voice in the record.

**Useful for:**

- Symptoms expressed in the patient’s own words
- Emotional or psychosocial concerns
- Sensitive issues that need exact phrasing

<Info>
  Quotes appear in quotation marks within the note for clarity.
</Info>

## <u>Abbreviations</u>

Toggle **Abbreviations** to use standard medical shorthand in your notes.

**Examples:**

- “HTN” for hypertension
- “DM” for diabetes mellitus
- “SOB” for shortness of breath

This keeps notes compact and faster to read for clinicians familiar with medical terminology.

<Tip>
  If you prefer expanded terms for clarity (e.g., for learners or patients), keep abbreviations off.
</Tip>

## <u>Bullets</u>

Enable **Bullets** to format lists as hyphenated or itemized lines. This is useful for problem lists, investigations, and treatment plans.

## <u>Paragraphs</u>

Toggle **Paragraphs** to generate narrative, prose-style notes. This is helpful when detailed context or continuous flow is needed.

**Benefits:**

- Ideal for consults and referrals
- Easier to read in narrative-heavy sections
- Can mirror traditional dictation styles

## Applying Customization

After adjusting settings, click **Regenerate Note** to apply them. Your note will be instantly reformatted with the chosen options.

<Info>
  You can change customization for one note, or update your **default settings** in the **Preferences** panel (bottom-left corner).
