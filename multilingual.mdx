# Multilingual Mode

You can now transcribe in **up to 3 languages simultaneously**.

Vero automatically captures each language spoken during the encounter, making it easy to support diverse patient populations.

## How to Enable

1. Start a **New Encounter**.
2. In the recording panel, click **Preferences**.
3. From the **Voice Language** dropdown, select up to 3 languages you frequently use in your practice.

Vero will detect and transcribe all chosen languages in real time.

  Vero will handle language switching seamlessly during your encounters.

## Example Use Cases

- Switching between English and French in a single visit.
- Supporting patients who move fluidly between English and Spanish.
- Adding a caregiver’s contributions in another language alongside the patient’s.

## Output Language

While you can record in multiple languages, you also have control over the **output language**. This ensures your final note is generated in the language best suited for documentation or patient communication.

## Why It Matters

- Breaks down communication barriers.
- Supports multilingual families and communities.
- Improves accuracy when patients and clinicians switch between languages naturally.
