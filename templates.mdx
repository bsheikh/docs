## Why Templates Matter

Templates are the backbone of efficient documentation in Vero. They define the structure of your notes so you spend less time formatting and more time on patient care.

You can use **community templates** designed by other clinicians, or build your own in just a few minutes.

<Note>
  Templates help ensure accuracy and consistency across encounters while giving you the flexibility to adapt them to your style of practice.
</Note>

## Browsing Templates

Open the **Templates** tab from the bottom-left-hand navigation.\
Here you’ll see two libraries:

- **My Library** – templates you’ve created or copied.
- **Community Templates** – templates shared by other trusted clinicians that you can adopt and customize.

Use the **search bar** or **sort menu** to quickly find what you need.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="My Library" icon="folder">
    Private templates you’ve created or copied into your account.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community Templates" icon="users">
    Templates shared by others. Copy any into your library and adjust them to fit your needs.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Creating a Template

Click **\+ Create Template** and choose how you’d like to start.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Blank Slate" icon="file-plus">
    Start fresh and design your own from scratch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Generated" icon="sparkles">
    Describe the type of note you want. Vero will generate a smart template for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Existing Note" icon="copy">
    Paste a past clinical note and Vero will convert it into a reusable template.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Import" icon="upload">
    Bring in a template from another source and Vero will adapt it for use.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Tip>
  The fastest option is **AI-Generated**. Just describe your ideal format (e.g., “SOAP note with vitals and medication section”) and Vero will draft it instantly.
</Tip>

## Template Builder

When editing a template, you’ll see three building blocks:

1. **Text** – Write static text that will appear as-is in the outputted Note. 
   - Example: `Subjective: `
2. **Fill-in Fields** – Use `[square brackets]` to mark areas that Vero will extract from your context (recordings, audio, files) and fill into the note.
   - Example: `[Medication name and dose]`
3. **Rules** – Use `(parentheses)` to guide Vero on formatting or grouping.
   - Example: `(use full medication names)`

<Info>
  Use clear, natural language. Vero understands instructions like “(list vitals in one line)” or “(use hyphenated bullets.)”
</Info>

### Pro Tips

- Be specific about formatting.
- Break complex sections into smaller steps.
- Add fallback instructions under `#User Instructions` at the bottom if needed.

## Privacy & Sharing

Every template has a **visibility setting** in the top-right corner:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Keep templates for your own use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community" icon="users">
    Share with all Vero users. Great for giving back.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team" icon="building">
    Share within your clinic or group practice.
  </Card>
</Columns>
