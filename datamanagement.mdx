- **Single Encounter** – Hover over an encounter in the left sidebar and click the **trash can icon**.
- **Entire Day** – Hover over a date heading (e.g., “Today” or “Yesterday”) and click the **trash can icon** to delete all encounters from that day.

## Automatic Deletion

You can also set up Vero to automatically delete encounters on a schedule.

1. Open **Settings** (bottom-left corner).
2. Go to **Data Management**.
3. Toggle on **Automatically delete encounters**.
4. Choose a timeframe between **1–90 days**.

<Note>
  This ensures your encounters are automatically cleared without you needing to remember.

## Clear All Data

If needed, you can wipe everything at once:

- Go to **Settings → Data Management**
- Select **Clear Encounters & Uploads**
- This will remove all encounters, uploads, and associated notes.

  This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
