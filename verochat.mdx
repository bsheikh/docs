## What is Vero Chat?

**Vero Chat** is your AI assistant built directly into the note editor. It allows you to refine your documentation, create patient-friendly instructions, and even ask medical questions without leaving your encounter.

<Note>
  Vero Chat appears at the **bottom of the screen** while you’re editing a note.

## Editing Your Note

You can ask Vero Chat to make changes in plain language.

- **Replace the note entirely** – e.g., “Rewrite this note in concise bullet points.”
- **Edit parts of the note** – e.g., “Add clear respiratory exam”
- **Ask it to change formatting **– e.g., "Make it more concise/detailed"

<Tip>
  This is the fastest way to iterate until your note looks exactly how you want.
</Tip>

## Asking Clinical Questions

Vero Chat can answer medical questions based on guidelines and your current note context.

**Examples:**

- “What red flags should I check for in abdominal pain?”
- “What is the differential diagnosis for new-onset headache?”
- “Which labs are recommended for suspected UTI?”
- "First line treatments for hyptertension in a diabetic patient?"

<Info>
  Vero Chat uses trusted guideline-informed references to provide structured, safe suggestions.\
  Always apply your own clinical judgment before acting on recommendations.

## Patient Instructions
