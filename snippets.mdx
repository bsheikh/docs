## Why Snippets Matter

Snippets are shortcuts for reusable text. They save time and reduce repetition in your notes.\
Think of them as your personal “/ commands” — one keystroke brings up full exam findings, plans, or counseling phrases.

<Note>
  Access your Snippets at the bottom-left corner of Vero.

</Columns>

Use the **search bar** to find what you need quickly.

## Creating a Snippet

Click **\+ Create Snippet** and complete three fields:

1. **Shorthand** – a short memorable trigger
   - Example: `/uti`
2. **Content** – the text block to insert.
   - Example: “Symptoms consistent with uncomplicated UTI”
3. **Description** (optional) – helps you remember its purpose.

    Type `/` in any note to see your snippet dropdown.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reusable Blocks" icon="lightbulb">
    Insert the same text across multiple templates and encounters.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Using Snippets in Notes

When typing in your note, just enter `/` and a dropdown menu of snippets will appear. Click or press enter and it inserts instantly.

This makes it easy to standardize and speed up common documentation.

## Common Use Cases

- **Physical exam findings** – e.g., “Vitals stable. Alert and oriented x3…”
- **Counseling phrases** – lifestyle, diet, smoking cessation.
- **Medication counseling** – side effects, dosing instructions.
- **Plans** – discharge, follow-up, referrals.
- **Procedures** – knee injection steps, consent language.

<Tip>
  Snippets are especially powerful when combined with Templates and Learnings. Templates give structure, Learnings personalize the style, and Snippets fill in the details instantly.
