description: "Add ICD-10 and ICD-10-CA fields to your templates so Vero can surface the right codes from your note context."

## What this does

Add ICD fields to a template. Vero reads the encounter note and proposes the most relevant code, ready to insert.

<Info>
  Supports **ICD-10** and **ICD-10-CA**. Pick the one your region uses.
</Info>

## Add ICD fields to a template

1. Open **Templates** → pick a template → **Edit**.
2. Click **Inserts**.
3. Add either fields:

```
ICD-10 Code: [Enter the most clinically relevant ICD-10 code for this encounter]
```

```
ICD-10-CA Code: [Enter the most clinically relevant ICD-10-CA code for this encounter]
```

4. Save the template.

<Tip>
  Place ICD fields after **Assessment** or **Diagnosis** for cleaner output.
</Tip>

## How Vero fills codes

Vero parses your generated note and Proposes the **most likely primary code** based on the assessment and plan.

<Note>
  You can edit or override the proposed code before export.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If the wrong code appears (e.g., low back pain): hard-code the correct code in your template for common edge cases so it always pulls correctly.

```
(ICD code for back pain is M54.5)
```

<Note>
  Do this for high-frequency items that are often misidentified.
