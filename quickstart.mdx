## 1. Start a New Encounter

In the top-left corner, click **New Encounter**.

Each encounter is a container for one patient visit, keeping your notes organized and preventing mix-ups.

## 2. Choose How to Create Your Note

Vero Scribe adapts to your workflow. Use one method or combine all three:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Record" icon="microphone">
    Transcribe or dictate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type" icon="file-word">
    Before, during or after.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uploads" icon="upload" href="/essentials/images">
    Documents, audio, images.
  </Card>
</Columns>

**Record (Transcribe or Dictate):** Capture a live consultation or dictate after the visit. Vero automatically transcribes and structures the dialogue.

**Type:** You can type notes before the encounter to pre-chart, during the encounter for details you may not want to say out loud, or after the visit to complete your documentation.

**Uploads:** You can choose to upload files that may help with the note. Vero will use these documents to help formulate the perfect note.

- **Documents (PDF, Doc, Docx, Text)**: Ideal for referral letters, discharge summaries, admission notes, and medication lists.
- **Audio (MP3, WAV, M4A)**: Record an encounter in another app and upload it later to generate a structured note.
- **Images (PNG, JPEF, WEBP)**: Upload photos of medication lists or other documents. Vero extracts the text from the photo and adds it to your note.

<Note>
  Use one method or combine all three to create the ultimate note.

## Select Template

Templates save time and keep your documentation consistent.

At the bottom-right of your screen, select the template you want to use for your note. Each template is designed by Vero specialists and trusted community members.

If you’d like to explore more options, click the **Templates** icon in the bottom-left corner. From there, you can browse **community templates** and **copy** any into your personal library for future use.

## Create your note

When ready, click '**Create Note**'. Vero will combine all input methods (audio, text and uploads) to create your perfect note template.

## Edit Your Note

After generating your draft, you can refine it in several ways.

- **Note customization: Open theCustomization**  window near the top toolbar to adjust the output. You can control the detail level (concise, balanced, or detailed) and toggle options like quotes, abbreviations, bullets, or paragraphs. Once ready, click generate note.
- **Type:** Click directly into the note and edit it as you would in any text editor.
- **Dictate:** Use the microphone icon on the toolbar to speak your updates and have them added instantly.
- **Vero Chat:** Open Vero Chat at the bottom of the screen and request edits in plain language. You can replace the note entirely or add new content alongside what’s already there.

<Tip>
  Vero Chat is also powerful for clinical support — you can ask it to add differential diagnoses or answer medical questions, and it will use your note and context to provide guideline-based information.
