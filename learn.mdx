## Why Learn Matters

Every clinician has a unique style of documentation. **Learn** allows Vero to adapt to yours.\
It captures the way you format, phrase, and structure your notes, so future drafts come out closer to what you’d write yourself.

<Note>
  We recommend optimizing your **template** first, then applying Learnings to refine it even further.
</Note>

## How to Use Learn

1. Finish editing your note.
2. In the top-right corner, click **Learn**.
3. Vero will store that note’s structure and style as a reference.

You can save up to **5 Learnings per template**.

<Tip>
  Keep your Learnings consistent. Use notes with similar style and structure so Vero picks up on the right patterns.
</Tip>

## What Vero Learns

Learnings capture much more than text:

- **Formatting** – bullet style, spacing, indentation.
- **Style** – full sentences vs. fragments, abbreviations, shorthand.
- **Content habits** – how you phrase diagnoses, plans, or counselling.
- **Signatures** – your credentials and sign-off format.
- **Nuances** – whether you prefer concise summaries or detailed expansions.

<Info>
  Each template has its own Learnings. You can teach different styles for consult notes, SOAP notes, or discharge summaries.

## Managing Learnings

At the bottom-left corner of Vero, open the **Learnings** tab. Here you can:

- Review the notes Vero has learned from.
- Add or remove Learnings.
- Reset and start fresh if your style changes.

## Best Practices

- Choose notes that **represent your ideal output**.
- Don’t mix radically different styles in one template’s Learnings.
- Periodically update your Learnings as your style evolves.
