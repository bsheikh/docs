## What Are Insights?

**Insights** are Vero’s built-in clinical feedback system.

After generating a note, you can click the Insights in the top-right corner to receive suggestions for improvement. Insights highlight what might be missing, important red flags, and additional considerations — helping you deliver safer, more thorough care.

<Note>
  Insights are not a replacement for clinical judgment. They are designed to support your reasoning, not replace it.
</Note>

## How Insights Work

Vero scans your generated note and organizes suggestions under each section depending on the template.

You’ll see:

- **Additional details** you may want to include
- **Red flags** to consider documenting or following up
- **Differential suggestions** relevant to the case
- **Clinical reminders** like vitals, social history, or physical exam findings

## Why Use Insights?

Insights are useful across all stages of practice:

- **Medical Students & Residents** – get structured feedback and avoid missing key questions or exam findings.
- **Practicing Physicians** – a second set of eyes to help ensure red flags aren’t overlooked.
- **Lifelong Learners** – stay sharp, reinforce guidelines, and refine your documentation style over time.

<Tip>
  Even experienced clinicians benefit from Insights. Think of it as a clinical checklist that evolves with you.

## Best Practices

- Review insights after generating your first draft.
- Use them as a **safety net**, not a script.
- Teach learners to compare their notes against Insights for self-correction.
- Incorporate relevant items into your note with a single edit.

<Info>
  Insights adapt to your **template and note style**. They are dynamic, patient specific and context aware.
