## Why We Offer This

We know training is hard. Between long hours, constant learning, and patient care, documentation can feel like one more burden. Vero Scribe was built to lighten that load and help you learn faster.

- With **Vero Insights**, you can use your notes as a feedback tool — surfacing red flags, missing details, and guideline-based suggestions.
- With **Vero Chat**, you can ask any medical-related question directly in the note editor, from differential diagnoses to drug dosages.

To support you during this stage of your career, we provide a **discounted plan for all students and trainees**.

## Who’s Eligible

All healthcare trainees and students, including:

- Medical residents and fellows
- Medical students
- Nursing students
- Physiotherapy students
- Dentistry students
- Pharmacy students
- Allied health and other accredited healthcare programs

If you’re in training, you may qualify.
